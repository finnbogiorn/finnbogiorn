              This shirt was printed in 2004. At the time, Mínus was the biggest rock band in Iceland.
              However, they were also considered the public enemy number 1 to Icelands aluminum smelting family.
              The graphic depicts Jesus Christ on a cross made out of the Icelandic flag.
              This broke 2 laws in the country at the time, 1. flag law which forbids any visual manipulation of the Icelandic flag.
              2. the law which forbids sacrilegious of religious imagery, which at the time was punishable by up to 3 months in prison.

              Due to the wicked nature of the design, the shirts were confiscated by Icelandic police forces,
              this was considered a fascist-like effort by the Icelandic government.
              These shirts would not see the light of day unless you found one purchased the week prior to the seize.
              Then in 2021 a box was unearthed and 15 of these were sold to the general public.
              I purchased one with the intent to preserve the graphic and eventually unearth it further in some way.
