                            May of 2004, Icelands nuclear family- (lets call it the aluminum smelting family) is threatened, a band of cocaine-snorting, booze drinking, street fighting, leopard print clad misfits has taken off in the mainstream. The band Mínus had just released their third full length album named after Icelandic nobel prize winning author Halldór Laxness, who’s most notable work tells the story of unwavering liberation of the self. One could argue that Mínus took this same route with their unwavering honest narrative of who they were as a band in the public eye.

                            The group started playing together in the late 90’s, and their sound was a darker, angrier, uncompromising take on the wave of metalcore that was happening in north America. They made Zao look like christian school boys. After the release of their 1999 debut LP Hey Johnny, the band received offers from poorly run labels worldwide such as Earache and Victory Records.

                            Tony Brummel was lucky enough to get them onto Victory for the North-American release of their second full length “Jesus Christ Bobby” - However, as the band was scheduled to tour the states with Darkest Hour, fair-haired bassist Johnny broke his hand fighting off a gang of football hooligans at a UK pub, and the band refused to replace him with a fill-in. This lead to a shouting match on the phone with the thieving little Chicago bitch boy Tony Brummel, and Mínus left the label.

                            If you haven’t picked up on it by now, Mínus weren’t nice boys, they played rock n roll. Eventually their sound developed further, and they mixed traditional rock elements reminiscent of Guns N’ Roses with their abrasive hardcore sound. People in Iceland still recall that it was like a full band of 1989 Axl Roses.

                            For their third full length, they started to take off on radio, production budgets for music videos got higher, and members started receiving their own level of fame individually. They played Reading and Leeds, toured with The Distillers, Avenged Sevenfold and opened for Metallica in front of 20,000 Icelanders.

                            Now that we’ve covered the history, lets talk about the merch. The band had controversy written all over them, they printed a shirt of famed Icelandic politician Davíð Oddson, with a pigs nose, decorated with the lyrics “My name is Cocaine”.

                            But the shirt that caused the biggest ruckus was this Jesus shirt. Printed on a Jerzees blank in 2004, features Jesus Christ clad in a hockey mask, crucified on the Icelandic flag. The shirt broke Icelandic flag law and so, in a fascist-like effort, Police was commanded to seize all of the shirts.

                            The shirts were hard to find and after this became a thing of legend, whenever I'd see one, my eyes would light up. I'd ask questions and inspect it with great interest. I asked every member throughout the years if they had a print file somewhere available, as I wanted to reprint them. At one point I even drew up a Great Grief shirt that was the same design, but sketched up in Procreate.

                            Thankfully in 2021, a box of these shirts was unearthed, and I was able to acquire one. I intend on keeping this design alive somehow, and we’ll see about the future.
