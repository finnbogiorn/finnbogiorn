                Pulling Teeth might be the best 2000â€™s hardcore band that got to play all the cool shows and still ended up incredibly slept on.
                They had more of a punk presence in terms of stage presence, although highly political, they were never macho.
                Stonethrowers is a perfect example of this. The band had a 3 album run that will never be matched by another act.

                Martyr Immortal to Paranoid Delusions / Paradise Illusions into funerary? Absolutely unreal trajectory.
                And then Pulling Teeth did the one thing every band should do, and broke up while they were on top.
                This shirt was purchased at an Iceland date they played in the basement venue of a college that no longer hosts shows in 2009.
